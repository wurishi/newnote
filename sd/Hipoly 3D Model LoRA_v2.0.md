This is a LoRA trained on high-polygon 3D model images.

It can provide clean, high-resolution skin and hair materials, as well as detailed clothing elements.

It can reproduce a more 3D-like texture and stereoscopi effect than ver.1

LoRA can be applied without a trigger word

The style can be controlled using `3d` and `realistic` tags

When added to Positive Prompt, it enhances the 3D feel

When added to Negative Prompt, it adds details such as clothing while maintaining the model's art style

The issue of eroding the model's art style with tags such as intricate , detailed has been alleviated

The effect of LoRA was confirmed using the following my custom merged models:

- Alstroemeria Mix
- Bougainvillea Mix
- Chrysanthemum Mix
